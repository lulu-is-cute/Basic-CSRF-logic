# Basic-CSRF-logic

In this repo we have 2 web apps (node) which are meant to be simple online notepads which save data in a file. When a user logs in it saves a cookie with the user's code in it. With the one that is doesn't have csrf protection then other websites can edit the user's notepad. This is why you always need CSRF protection.

# How to use
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
